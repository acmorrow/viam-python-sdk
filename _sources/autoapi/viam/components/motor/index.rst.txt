.. py:class:: MotorClient(name: str, channel: grpclib.client.Channel)



   gRPC client for the Motor component.

   .. py:method:: set_power(self, power: float)
      :async:

      Sets the "percentage" of power the motor should employ between -1 and 1.
      When `power` is negative, the rotation will be in the backward direction.

      :param power: Power between -1 and 1
                    (negative implies backwards).
      :type power: float


   .. py:method:: go_for(self, rpm: float, revolutions: float)
      :async:

      Spin the motor the specified number of `revolutions` at specified `rpm`.
      When `rpm` or `revolutions` is a negative value, the rotation will be in the backward direction.
      Note: if both `rpm` and `revolutions` are negative, the motor will spin in the forward direction.

      :param rpm: Speed at which the motor should move in rotations per minute
                  (negative implies backwards).
      :type rpm: float
      :param revolutions: Number of revolutions the motor should run for
                          (negative implies backwards).
      :type revolutions: float


   .. py:method:: go_to(self, rpm: float, position_revolutions: float)
      :async:

      Spin the motor to the specified position (provided in revolutions from home/zero),
      at the specified speed, in revolutions per minute.
      Regardless of the directionality of the `rpm` this function will move
      the motor towards the specified position.

      :param rpm: Speed at which the motor should rotate (absolute value).
      :type rpm: float
      :param position_revolutions: Target position relative to home/zero, in revolutions.
      :type position_revolutions: float


   .. py:method:: reset_zero_position(self, offset: float)
      :async:

      Set the current position (modified by `offset`) to be the new zero (home) position.

      :param offset: The offset from the current position to new home/zero position.
      :type offset: float


   .. py:method:: get_position(self) -> float
      :async:

      Report the position of the motor based on its encoder.
      The value returned is the number of revolutions relative to its zero position.
      This method will raise an exception if position reporting is not supported by the motor.

      :returns: Number of revolutions the motor is away from zero/home.
      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: get_features(self) -> viam.components.motor.motor.Motor.Features
      :async:

      Report a dictionary mapping optional features to
      whether it is supported by this motor.

      :returns: Map of feature names to supported status.
      :rtype: Features


   .. py:method:: stop(self)
      :async:

      Stop the motor immediately, without any gradual step down.


   .. py:method:: is_powered(self) -> bool
      :async:

      Returns whether or not the motor is currently running.

      :returns: Indicates whether the motor is currently powered.
      :rtype: bool


   .. py:method:: do(self, command: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]
      :async:

      Send/Receive arbitrary commands

      :param command: The command to execute
      :type command: Dict[str, Any]

      :raises NotImplementedError: Raised if the component does not support arbitrary commands

      :returns: Result of the executed command
      :rtype: Dict[str, Any]



.. py:class:: Motor(name: str)



   Base component.
   All components must inherit from this class.
